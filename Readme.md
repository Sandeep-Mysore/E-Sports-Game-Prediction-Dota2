E-Sports Game Prediction

Domain: Data Mining, Machine Learning.

Technologies & Concepts: Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, KNN, LR, NB, DTree, Pruned classification tree, SVM, Cross Validation

The purpose of the project was to predict the winner of a DOTA2 Game based on in-game statistics like Gold and experience (Xp) accumulated by each team at different time intervals.
The Dataset, Dota-2-matches, used for our prediction has been sourced from Kaggle. 
The dataset was cleaned and manipulated as part of our approach.
60% of the data was used to train our model using Random Sampling and the remaining 40% for our preliminary testing.
We built models in Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Na√Øve Bayes, decision tree, Pruned Classification tree and Support Vector Machine to compare the prediction performance.
10-fold Cross validation was used to validate the model.
Various evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F-Score and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) were used to compare the performance of our models.
The Logistic Regression model, in this case, performed the best.
